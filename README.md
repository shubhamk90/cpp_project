In this Hotel Management Project, we have the 
information of the items or rooms that we have, 
what food items are ordered by the customer, 
and how many rooms are allotted to them. 
Also, this project will tell us about the sales and the remaining food stock 
we have in the hotel, and the total collection of the day.
